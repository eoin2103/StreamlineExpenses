## Abstract
More and more companies are adopting cloud-based solutions to expense management. One of the main reasons for these businesses adopting these solutions is due to the costs involved with regular expense reporting these costs are as a result of the time that is wasted in the process of submitting and approving or investigating a claim. It takes an average of 20 minutes for an expense report to be completed with the average cost of processing that report being USD 58. On average 19% of those submitted reports will contain some kind of error, this leads to a further average of 18 minutes being taken for that report to be corrected which leads to a further cost to the company of an average of USD 52.

With the above facts in mind the aim of this project is to tackle the issues of outdated and inefficient expense claim filling in businesses worldwide. This project endeavours to rectify this through the use of a web-based expense filing system which allows employees to enter their expense claims to be reviewed by the appropriate manager, any previously submitted claims that employee has made are displayed to them on their account home page.
The hope for this project is the reduce the costs associated with expense claims by making the process more streamline and easy to use thus saving time and money for companies that could potentially adopt the system.
